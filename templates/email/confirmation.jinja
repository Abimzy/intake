Hi {{ name }},

Thanks for applying online to Clear My Record. Your application will go to the San Francisco Public Defender’s Clean Slate program.

In about 2-4 weeks, the San Francisco Public Defender will send you a letter in the mail telling you what you qualify for and what to do next. Keep an eye on your mail. We’ll follow up with you around that time to make sure you received the letter.

Take care,
